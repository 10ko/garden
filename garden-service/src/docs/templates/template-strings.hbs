# Template strings reference

Below you'll find the schema for the keys available when interpolating template strings (see our
[Configuration Files](../using-garden/configuration-files.md) guide for information and usage examples).

Note that there are two sections below, because Project configs and Module configs have different keys available to
them. Please make sure to refer to the correct section.

## Project configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `project` key in `garden.yml` files:

```yaml
{{{projectContext}}}
```

## Module configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `module` key in `garden.yml` files:

```yaml
{{{moduleContext}}}
```
