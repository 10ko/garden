# Template strings reference

Below you'll find the schema for the keys available when interpolating template strings (see our
[Configuration Files](../using-garden/configuration-files.md) guide for information and usage examples).

Note that there are three sections below, because Project configs and Module configs have different keys available to
them, and additional keys are available under `providers` in Project configs.
Please make sure to refer to the correct section.

## Project configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings anywhere in Project `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml
{{{projectContext}}}
```

## Provider configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `providers`Â key (or `environments[].providers)
in Project `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml
{{{providerContext}}}
```

## Module configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under Module `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml
{{{moduleContext}}}
```
