# Template strings reference

Below you'll find the schema for the keys available when interpolating template strings (see our
[Configuration Files](../using-garden/configuration-files.md) guide for information and usage examples).

Note that there are three sections below, because Project configs and Module configs have different keys available to
them, and additional keys are available under `providers` in Project configs.
Please make sure to refer to the correct section.

## Project configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings anywhere in Project `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml
# Type: object
#
local:
  # A map of all local environment variables (see
  # https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).
  #
  # Type: object
  #
  env:

  # A string indicating the platform that the framework is running on (see
  # https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform)
  #
  # Type: string
  #
  # Example: "posix"
  #
  platform:

  # The current username (as resolved by https://github.com/sindresorhus/username)
  #
  # Type: string
  #
  # Example: "tenzing_norgay"
  #
  username:
```

## Provider configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `providers`Â key (or `environments[].providers)
in Project `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml
# Type: object
#

  # A map of all local environment variables (see
  # https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).
  #
  # Type: object

  #
  platform:

  #
  # Type: string
  #
  # Example: "tenzing_norgay"
  #
  username:

# Information about the environment that Garden is running against.
#
# Type: object
#
environment:
  # The name of the environment Garden is running against.
  #
  # Type: string
  #

#
project:
  # The name of the Garden project.
  #
  # Type: string

  #
  name:

# Retrieve information about providers that are defined in the project.
#
# Type: object

#   kubernetes:
#     config:
#       clusterHostname: my-cluster.example.com
#
providers: {}
```

## Module configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under Module `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml

  # https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).
  #

  # Example: "posix"
  #
  platform:

  # The current username (as resolved by https://github.com/sindresorhus/username)
