Just getting started now...

## Testing

    npm test
  
#### CI

We use [Circle CI](https://circleci.com) for integration testing. Sometimes
it can be useful to test and debug the CI build locally, particularly when 
updating or adding dependencies. You can use their 
[CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-jobs/) for that, which
is installed automatically by the `./bin/bootstrap-osx` script. Once you
have it installed you can run `circleci build` in the repo root to test 
the build locally.
